In this game, you are a car that just happened to end up driving on the opposite side of the road on 4 lanes of traffic. Maneuver around cars with the right and left arrow keys. A health bar is in the upper left corner of the screen. Pay attention to it. When it disappears, it's game over. If you make 200 moves without dying, you win! Try to beat your previous scores! Have fun.

- after taking a hit, you do have a short invinsibility (don't take that as the program not working).

-Also, the third image occurs when you have moved 50 and 150 times.
